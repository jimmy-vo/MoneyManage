# Money Manage
This is my first Android app I made the app after I finished the BIT's first term at Red River College, using the knowledge from Financial Accounting and Java courses.

The idea comes from my note taking habit as I noted all my expenses and transactions to the excel file. By the time, the file is so heavy. I needed to open my laptop whenever I want to see and adjust the file. Therefore I decided to bring it to Android, in which I can open my notes anywhere.

One thing I really like about this project is I was able to use the Financial Accounting techniques from the course, which are impressive. Those Financial rules are cool, quite simple, but not everyone knows. If you don't have these skills you may be struggling when you want to look into your expensive and income.


## What can you do with this app:
```
* Create, reorder, remove, hide or activate accounts
* Add, remove, edit transactions
* Change the columns order
* Manage under file system - create new files, remove files, select files
* Upload and download with GoogleDrive
* Calculate ending balance
* Show summary of all files 
* Calculate the summation of activated credit and debit accounts
```
